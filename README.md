# Predicting Wind Turbine Capacity

Final project for STAT 535 at UW. Each student was given a classifier and the same training dataset with the goal of achieving lowest MSE on the test dataset. My K nearest neighbors regression model predicting the wind turbine capacity achieved 2nd place out of 21. 

The details of the end-to-end workflow are described in `AB_Final_Project.pdf` with accompanying code in `final_project.ipynb`.
